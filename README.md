# Java-Programming
This repository contains the study materials of Coursera's introductory course to Java programming and computer science by Princeton. Also, I post my code for the weekly assignments periodically.

# Thoughts about the course
This mooc by Princeton is a great start point for anyone who is interested in :
  1. learning basic programming concepts. 
     It can be difficult for a beginner, but I would say it's worth it.
  2. getting a grasp of what Java programming is like. 
     Well, in that case, I would assume you are a somewhat seasoned programmer. Then the pdfs and assignments should be sufficient enough.
