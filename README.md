# Java-Programming

This repository contains the study materials of Coursera's introductory course to Java programming and computer science by Princeton. Also, I post my code for the weekly assignments periodically.

# Thoughts about the course

This mooc by Princeton is a great start point for anyone who is interested in :
  1. learning basic programming concepts. 
     It can be difficult for a beginner, but I would say it's worth it.
  2. getting a grasp of what Java programming is like. 
     Well, in that case, I would assume you are a somewhat seasoned programmer. Then the pdfs and assignments should be sufficient enough.
  3. procrastinating while learning.
     Yes. I am writing this one down. I found it's easier/happier/healthier to procrastinate while I'm doing something else. It almost sounds like I am not procrastinating but **busy** with some other stuff. My **bad** deed seems to justify to be some meaningful action. Although my consciousness won't abide by this lie. But you know, at least I'm trying. Life is hard.

# Notes on the Assignments

## [Week 1: Basic Programming Concepts](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/hello/specification.php)
1. **_HelloGoodbye_**

Be careful with the message you print out. It should be `Hello A and B.` and then `Goodbye B and A.`. I know it's a straight forward question, but you can't blame me for underestimating a HelloWorld program. No, don't judge me. Just admit that it's a fair point.

2. **_Integers and booleans_**

Just aware that the command-line arguments are not necessarily sequential. Pay attention to the corner cases. Other than that is just basic programming.

3. **_Floating-point numbers and the Math library_**

Copy and paste:

> Hint: The command-line arguments are given in degrees but Java’s trigonometric functions use radians. Use Math.toRadians() to convert from degrees to radians.

4. **_Type conversion_**

Calculate the rgb value (which should be int) **after** you process all the white, read, green, blue values (which should be double).

Voilà! There you have it! If you get stuck for hours, you can take a look at [my code](https://github.com/amir0320/Java-Programming/tree/master/01_basic-programming-concepts/homework). But I would recommend you writing your own version of code instead of just copying mine. That's how you can get the most out of this learning experience.
