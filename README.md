# Java-Programming

This repository contains the study materials of Coursera's introductory course to Java programming and computer science by Princeton. Also, I post my code for the weekly assignments periodically.

# Thoughts about the course

This mooc by Princeton is a great start point for anyone who is interested in :
  1. learning basic programming concepts.
     It can be difficult for a beginner, but I would say it's worth it.
  2. getting a grasp of what Java programming is like.
     Well, in that case, I would assume you are a somewhat seasoned programmer. Then the pdfs and assignments should be sufficient enough.
  3. procrastinating while learning.
     Yes. I am writing this one down. I found it's easier/happier/healthier to procrastinate while I'm doing something else. It almost sounds like I am not procrastinating but **busy** with some other stuff. My **bad** deed seems to justify to be some meaningful action. Although my consciousness won't abide by this lie. But you know, at least I'm trying. Life is hard.

# Notes on the Assignments

## [Week 1: Basic Programming Concepts](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/hello/specification.php)
1. **_HelloGoodbye_**

  Be careful with the message you print out. It should be `Hello A and B.` and then `Goodbye B and A.`. I know it's a straight forward question, but you can't blame me for underestimating a HelloWorld program. No, don't judge me. Just admit that it's a fair point.

2. **_Integers and booleans_**

  Just aware that the command-line arguments are not necessarily sequential. Pay attention to the corner cases. Other than that is just basic programming.

3. **_Floating-point numbers and the Math library_**

  Copy and paste:

  > Hint: The command-line arguments are given in degrees but Java’s trigonometric functions use radians. Use Math.toRadians() to convert from degrees to radians.

4. **_Type conversion_**

  Calculate the rgb value (which should be int) **after** you process all the white, red, green, blue values (which should be double).

Voilà! There you have it! If you get stuck for hours, you can take a look at [my code](https://github.com/amir0320/Java-Programming/tree/master/01_basic-programming-concepts/homework). But I would recommend you writing your own version of code instead of just copying mine. That's how you can get the most out of this learning experience.

## [Week 2: Conditionals and Loops](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/loops/specification.php)
1. **_Generalized harmonic numbers_**

  A simple for loop will do the work.

2. **_Band matrices_**

  I use a string to store every row pattern and print them out recursively. However, the String concatenation method is not necessary here. You can certainly improve the memory efficiency by using alternative implementation. I'm just too lazy to change my code.

3. **_Random walk_**

  Just keep track of the current position (x and y coordinates) and the number of steps taken, and everything else should be alright. You know, just some basic coding and debugging time spent here and there...

4. **_Random walkers_**

  `Random Walker` within a loop. Mic drop.

Hmm, I start wondering if anyone would ever take time reading this. If it turns out to be a self-entertain act, I wouldn't be discouraged.  I'm actually getting some level of enjoyment out of this.
